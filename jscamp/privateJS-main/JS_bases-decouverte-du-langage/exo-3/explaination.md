Initialization

javascript
Copy code
console.log('exo-3');
The script starts by logging 'exo-3' to the console. This appears to be a simple identifier or title for the script.
Player Input

javascript
Copy code
var playerInput = prompt("Your choice (rock, paper, scissors)?");
This line prompts the user to enter their choice for the game: either rock, paper, or scissors. The choice is stored in the variable playerInput.
Function: getPlayerChoice

javascript
Copy code
function getPlayerChoice(playerInput) {
    return playerInput.toLowerCase();
}
This function takes the player's input and converts it to lowercase. This ensures that the game is not case-sensitive (e.g., 'Rock', 'rock', 'ROCK' are all treated the same).
Function: getProgramChoice

javascript
Copy code
function getProgramChoice() {
    var choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'];
    var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length);
    return choices[randomIndex];
}
This function randomly selects the program's choice (rock, paper, or scissors). It creates an array of possible choices, generates a random index, and then returns the choice at that index.
Function: determineWinner

javascript
Copy code
function determineWinner(playerChoice, programChoice) {
    // ...
}
This function takes the choices of both the player and the program to determine the winner. It compares the two choices and follows the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors to decide who wins, loses, or if it's a tie.
Function: playGame

javascript
Copy code
function playGame() {
    // ...
}
This function orchestrates the game. It first retrieves the player's choice (converted to lowercase for consistency) and the program's random choice. Then it logs both choices to the console and determines the winner by calling determineWinner.
Starting the Game

javascript
Copy code
playGame();
Finally, the playGame function is called to start the game.
When this script is run, it will prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors, then the program makes a random choice, and the winner is determined based on these choices. The results are displayed in the console.
