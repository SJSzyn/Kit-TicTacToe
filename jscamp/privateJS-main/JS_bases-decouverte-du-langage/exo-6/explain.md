Initialize and Print a Console Log

javascript
Copy code
console.log("exo-6");
It starts by logging 'exo-6' to the console, probably as a reference to an exercise number.
Define joeInfo Object

An object joeInfo is defined containing properties about Joe's house like name, number of rooms, whether there's a garage, number of bathrooms, and a list of cars.
Joe's Cars, Bathrooms, and Garage Updates

The script first prints the number of cars Joe has using joeInfo.cars.length.
Then, it updates the number of bathrooms to 1 and prints the new number.
Finally, it updates the garage status to true and prints whether Joe has a garage.
Define Team Object with Methods

The team object is initialized with two properties: players and games, both set to empty arrays.
Two methods, addPlayer and addGame, are added to this object. addPlayer adds a new player object to the players array, and addGame adds a new game object to the games array.
Adding Players and Games

The script adds a couple of players and games directly to the team object using the push method.
Then, it uses the addPlayer and addGame methods to add more players and games.
Display Updated Players and Games Lists

After additions, the updated lists of players and games are logged to the console.
Calculate and Display Total Team Points

A function calculateTotalPoints calculates the total points the team has scored across all games by iterating through the games array.
The total points are then printed.
Calculate and Display Average Opponent Points

calculateAverageOpponentPoints function computes the average points scored by opponents.
This average is printed to the console.
Find and Display the Oldest Player

findOldestPlayer function determines the oldest player in the team.
It prints the oldest player's details or a message if there are no players.
Sort and Display Players Alphabetically by Last Name

sortPlayersAlphabetically function sorts the players by their last names in alphabetical order.
The sorted list of players is then displayed.
This code demonstrates object manipulation, array handling, and the use of functions for specific tasks like adding data, calculating totals and averages, and sorting data. It's a great example of basic data management in JavaScript, commonly used in web applications for handling and displaying information.
