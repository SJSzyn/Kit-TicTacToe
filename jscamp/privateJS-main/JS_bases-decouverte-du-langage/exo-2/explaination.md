Here, the code starts with a console.log statement to print 'exo-2', which could be a reference to the name or identifier of this script.
Then, a constant isTesting is declared and set to true. This indicates that the script is currently in a testing mode. If it were false, the script would run in normal operation mode.
Variable Declarations

let dayOfWeek;
let endOfWeekdayHour;
These lines declare two variables, dayOfWeek and endOfWeekdayHour, which will later store the current day of the week and the current hour of the day, respectively.
Testing Mode Logic

The if statement checks if isTesting is true. If it is, the script enters a block of code designed for testing purposes.
Inside this block, it prompts the user to enter a fictitious day and time using prompt functions. These values are stored in inputDay and inputHour.
The input values are then converted from string to integer using parseInt and assigned to dayOfWeek and endOfWeekdayHour.
Normal Operation Logic

If isTesting is false, the script fetches the current date and time using new Date().
The day of the week and the hour are extracted from this date object and assigned to dayOfWeek and endOfWeekdayHour.
Message Variables

Two message strings are declared: weekdayMsg and weekendMsg, with messages for weekdays and weekends respectively.
Displaying Current Time Information

The script logs the current dayOfWeek and endOfWeekdayHour to the console.
Determining the Message to Display

The final if statement determines which message to display based on the day and time.
It checks various conditions:
If it’s Tuesday (dayOfWeek > 1) to Thursday (dayOfWeek < 5), it's a weekday.
If it’s Monday (dayOfWeek === 1) but past 9 AM (endOfWeekdayHour >= 9), it's also considered a weekday.
If it’s Friday (dayOfWeek === 5) but before 5 PM (endOfWeekdayHour < 17), it's still a weekday.
Depending on these conditions, it either logs weekdayMsg or weekendMsg.
In summary, this script determines whether it's currently a weekday or a weekend based on the day and time. It has a testing mode where you can manually input a day and time for testing purposes.
