
The instructions in the README.md file outline several advanced JavaScript exercises, mainly focusing on arithmetic operations, array and object manipulations, and enhancing function robustness and flexibility. Here's a breakdown of the tasks and an example of what the code might look like for each:

Arithmetic - Further Exploration:

Create a function to determine if one number is evenly divisible by another, within the range ]-Number.MIN_VALUE; Number.MAX_VALUE[ and if the result is an even integer.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
function isDivisibleEvenly(val1, val2) {
    if (val2 === 0 || !Number.isFinite(val1 / val2)) return false;
    return (val1 / val2) % 2 === 0;
}
Arrays and Loops - Further Exploration:

Write a function to compare two arrays, considering "4" equal to 4.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
function areArraysEqual(arr1, arr2) {
    if (arr1.length !== arr2.length) return false;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        if (arr1[i] == arr2[i]) continue;
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
Objects - Further Exploration:

Create a function to compare two objects, again treating "4" as equal to 4.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
function areObjectsEqual(o1, o2) {
    const keys1 = Object.keys(o1);
    const keys2 = Object.keys(o2);
    if (keys1.length !== keys2.length) return false;
    for (const key of keys1) {
        if (o1[key] != o2[key]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
Functions - Further Exploration:

Comment your functions properly, defining preconditions and postconditions.
Ensure preconditions are met at the start of the function, returning an error value otherwise.
Example Comment:
javascript
Copy code
/**
 * Checks if one number is evenly divisible by another within a specific range.
 * Preconditions:
 *   - val1: Number, in the range of Number.MIN_VALUE to Number.MAX_VALUE
 *   - val2: Number, non-zero, in the range of Number.MIN_VALUE to Number.MAX_VALUE
 * Postconditions:
 *   - Returns true if val1/val2 is an even integer, false otherwise.
 */
Variadic Functions - Further Exploration:

Modify the functions for arrays and objects to accept a variable number of arguments.
Return true if all arguments are equal as per the defined criteria in their respective exercises.
Example Modification:
javascript
Copy code
function areArraysEqual(...arrays) {
    if (arrays.length === 1) return true;
    // Compare arrays[0] with the rest...
}
These exercises aim to enhance your understanding of JavaScript's capabilities, particularly in terms of data manipulation and function design. The examples provided are basic implementations and can be further refined to suit specific needs or constraints.
